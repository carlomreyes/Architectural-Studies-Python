    "This paper documents and formalizes a foundational computational design methodology developed through a sequence of introductory Python-based architectural exercises. The intent of this document is not to serve as a programming tutorial, but rather to bridge the gap between Python as a formal language and architectural design thinking. By exploring computational design through fundamental geometric primitives (2D and eventually 3D), this framework aims to illuminate the underlying logic of computational design systems—logic that remains consistent whether expressed through text-based code (Python), visual programming environments (Grasshopper, Dynamo), or hybrid approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to make explicit the computational design pipeline and the architectural coding grammar implicitly used in projects such as Project 01_2 (Square) and related geometric exercises within the A_Shapes collection. This understanding provides a conceptual foundation for working fluently across multiple computational design platforms and for leveraging Python's capabilities within visual programming environments. The approach situates basic programming constructs within architectural design thinking, emphasizing parametric intent, reproducibility, and system-based form generation."
